Also contains the custom_classifier class.\n\n## DATA_SHARING_USAGE\n\nViews that display object metadata and usage metrics related to listings published in the Snowflake Marketplace or a data exchange.\n\n## EXTERNAL_ACCESS\n\nSchema that contains built-in network rules specific to connections for network traffic outbound from Snowflake.\n\n## INFORMATION_SCHEMA\n\nThis schema is automatically created in all databases. In a shared database, such as SNOWFLAKE, this schema doesn’t serve a purpose and can be disregarded.\n\n## LOCAL\n\nThis schema is used by some account-level Snowflake features for logging to telemetry event tables. For more information about this schema, see LOCAL.\n\n## ML\n\nContains ML functions, which is a suite of analysis tools built by Snowflake, and the DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE class used in Document AI.\n\n## MONITORING\n\nViews that provide historical information for objects in your account. In the Information Schema, the views and table functions that return historical information will eventually be migrated to the MONITORING schema in the future.\n\n## NETWORK_SECURITY\n\nSchema that contains built-in network rules that define the set of allowed IP addresses that a frequently used, third-party partner application uses to connect with Snowflake. For more information about Snowflake-managed network rules, see Snowflake-managed network rules.\n\n## NOTIFICATION\n\nStored procedures and functions for sending notifications.\n\n## ORGANIZATION_USAGE\n\nViews that display historical usage data across all the accounts in your organization.\n\n## READER_ACCOUNT_USAGE\n\nSimilar to ACCOUNT_USAGE, but only contains views relevant to the reader accounts (if any) provisioned for the account\n\n## SPCS\n\nFunctions for use with Snowpark Container Services.\n\n## TELEMETRY\n\n\nTables, views, and stored procedures to support collecting telemetry data such as log messages, trace event data, and metrics data.\n\n## TRUST_CENTER\n\nViews that display data about the Trust Center extensions.\n\n",
